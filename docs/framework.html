    <h1 id="introduction">Facilitating Access to Musical Experiences (FAME) framework</h1>

<p>Facilitating Access to Musical Experiences (FAME) is a framework that helps Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) designers and developers better understand facilitated performance and other accessible music making practices.</p>

<p>There are three ways in which the FAME framework does this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Explaining Facilitated Performance - including the stakeholders, activities and roles that are part of accesible music making.</li>
  <li>Providing guidance for using DMIs in Facilitated Performance</li>
  <li>The DMI Accessibility checklist - provides a checklist tool for evaluating the accessibility features of a DMI.</li>
</ol>

<p>The FAME framework aims to <strong>promote accessibility as a foundation</strong> for Digital Musical Instruments and related technologies.</p>

<p>Through <strong>sharing knowledge</strong> about accessible music making, <strong>providing guidance</strong> on the affordances for accessibility within spefic technologies and encouraging DMI creators to adopt <strong>better practices</strong> regarding accessibility.</p>

<h2 id="status">Document Status</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Version: 1.0 (Draft) Amy Dickens, 18th January 2019</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who">Who is it for?</h2>

<p>The following groups of people may find FAME useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Digital Musical Instrument Creators</li>
  <li>Accessible Music Making Communities</li>
  <li>Researchers</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="digital-musical-instrument-creators">Digital Musical Instrument Creators</h3>

<p>Firstly, the framework is designed to aid those involved in creating DMIs. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developers</li>
  <li>Designers</li>
  <li>Product Managers</li>
  <li>Manufacturers</li>
</ul>

<p>It aims to provide insight into the activities of facilitated musical performance, as well as help DMI creators to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better understand the needs of a facilitator</li>
  <li>Evaluate their products against accessibility requirements</li>
  <li>Incorporate accessibility into their product design</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="accessible-music-making-communities">Accessible Music Making Communities</h3>

<p>Secondly, the framework could be useful to anyone involved in the activity of facilitated performance and accessible music making:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facilitators</li>
  <li>Teachers</li>
  <li>Musicians</li>
  <li>Program Managers</li>
  <li>Buyers of DMIs for community programs</li>
</ul>

<p>For these people, the framework aims to provide guidance on the accessibility features of DMIs and help them to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better identify accessible features of DMIs</li>
  <li>Evaluate DMIs based on their project requirements</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="researchers">Researchers</h3>

<p>Finally, such a framework may be of use to any person conducting research in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital Musical Instruments</li>
  <li>Accessible Music Making</li>
  <li>Accessible Technology</li>
  <li>Accessibility Standards</li>
</ul>

<p>The areas outlined are purposefully broad. Researchers are advised to read the next section “What does it look at?” for information on the academic reach of this particular framework.</p>

<h2 id="what">The limits of the FAME Framework</h2>

<p>The FAME framework considers the accessibility requirements of digital musical instruments in the context of facilitated performance and related activities, which are outlined in the “What is Facilitated Performance?” section.</p>

<p>Some of the accessibility requirements highlighted by the FAME framework may also be applicable to other music technologies (and in use cases outside of Facilitated Performance). Whilst it is hoped that the FAME framework will be compatible with other guidelines regarding best practices for developing accessible music technologies; it is important to note that this framework is only intended for assessing the accessibility of digital musical instruments in the context of Facilitated Performance.</p>

<p>The DMIs observed in developing the FAME framework are considered consumer products and are available to purchase (at the time of writing). Additionally a singular bespoke gesture controlled DMI was created for the purpose of the research, but beyond this FAME does not take into account any novel or emerging technologies. However guidance provided within the FAME framework could be applied to such technologies.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that as technology evolves, new questions may arise regarding accessibility recommendations for the context of facilitated performance. The FAME framework will need to reflect this evolution, such that future versions may be required to address new accessibility requirements for DMIs and facilitated performance.</p>

<h2 id="how">How was it developed?</h2>

<p>The Facilitating Access to Musical Experiences (FAME) framework is a product of the “Facilitated Performance with Digital Musical Instruments” PhD research conducted by Amy Dickens of the Mixed Reality Laboratory, The University of Nottingham.</p>

<p>The following methods were used to inform the framework:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Observation of Facilitated Performance</li>
  <li>Review of Accessible Technology Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Observation of Facilitated Performance</strong></p>

<p>This included active observation of the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Workshops for musical exploration</li>
  <li>Structure Workshops for Creating a musical piece</li>
  <li>Rehearsals in preparation for live performance</li>
  <li>Live performances</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these activities followed a structure that involved musical and other facilitators assisting the musicians in their work. Recommendations made within this framework are routed in making DMIs more accessible for these particular settings.</p>

<p>It is recognised that the following activites can also follow such structure involving facilitators:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Musical Therapy</li>
  <li>Accessible Music Community Events (workshops etc.)</li>
  <li>Research</li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations made may support making DMIs more accessible for these settings also.</p>

<p><strong>Review of Accessible Technology Documentation</strong></p>

<p>FAME takes into consideration guidelines that outline the needs of people with disabilites when interacting with technology. Sources for outlining such needs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Aegis Information and Communication Technologies Open Accessibility Framework</li>
  <li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</li>
  <li>Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST) (Currently an Editor’s Draft)</li>
  <li>Web AIM Conceptual Framework for Accessibility Tools to Benefit Users with Cognitive Disabilities</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="facilitated-performance">What is Facilitated Performance?</h1>

<p>Facilitated performance describes a practice in which a musician/performer is supported by another person (a facilitator) in the activities of musical performance.</p>

<p>Facilitators can offer musical, technical or physical support for the musician/performer.</p>

<h2 id="facilitating-activities">The Activites of Facilitated Performance</h2>

<p>In this framework, we will group the activities related to facilitated performance into four categories that reflect the life-cycle of musical performance; create, practice, perform, reflect.</p>

<h2 id="roles">The Roles of a Facilitator</h2>

<h2 id="personas">Facilitator Personas</h2>

<h1 id="dmis">Digital Musical Instruments in Facilitated Performance</h1>

<h2 id="dmi-what">What is a Digital Musical Instrument?</h2>
